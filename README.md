# Online Multiplayersystem (current)

This project focuses on a online multiplayersystem where several users - several clients - do a handshake with the game server, which waits for request and processes them. The direction (i.e. where the project goes) is yet not determined. I will try and add functionalities like multiple users joining parallel and keep playing the game and more...

This endeavor goes beyond traditional coding, creating a space where players can come together for collaborative adventures and strategic battles. The use of "localhost" as the default server address demonstrates a commitment to security and flexibility, making it easy for contributors to test the system locally.
